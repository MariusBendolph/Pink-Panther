    <h2>Why Panthers?</h2>
    <blockquote>
      I've always had a thing for big wild cats, and the panther stands out to me more than any other. It's sleek, stealthy, strong, fierce, and strikingly beautiful — its fur like flowing silk under moonlight.
      <br><br>
      To me, the panther represents disguise and quiet power. It evokes a feeling of hidden strength — that at any moment, I can pounce and strike with purpose. I think others would appreciate panthers just as much, because we rarely encounter them in everyday life. I’ve never even seen one in a zoo.
